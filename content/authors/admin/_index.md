My name is Tran Van Hoang, and I am a student majoring in Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence at JeonBuk National University. I am interested in learning about computer systems, programming, and artificial intelligence. During my studies, I am gaining basic knowledge and practical skills related to IT and software development. I hope to continue improving my abilities and apply what I learn to future projects.

제 이름은 짠반황입니다. 저는 전북대학교에서 컴퓨터인공지능학부 인공지능을 전공하고 있습니다. 컴퓨터 시스템, 프로그래밍, 인공지능 분야에 관심이 많습니다. 학업을 통해 IT 및 소프트웨어 개발과 관련된 기초 지식과 실무 능력을 쌓고 있습니다. 앞으로도 계속해서 역량을 향상시키고, 배운 내용을 미래의 프로젝트에 적용하고 싶습니다.
